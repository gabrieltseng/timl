# Yield Estimation

Task-Informed Meta-Learning applied to yield estimation, using the yield dataset first described in [Deep Gaussian Process for Crop Yield Prediction Based on Remote Sensing Data](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/papers/cropyield_AAAI17.pdf). We recreate this dataset using the [PyTorch implementation](https://github.com/gabrieltseng/pycrop-yield-prediction/), rerun with all default arguments.
